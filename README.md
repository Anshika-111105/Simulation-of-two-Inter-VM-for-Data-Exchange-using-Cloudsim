# CloudSi
This project leverages CloudSim, a cloud simulation toolkit, to model and simulate application virtualization and inter-VM data exchange in a cloud computing environment. It demonstrates how cloud resources are allocated, how virtual machines (VMs) handle application workloads, and how data is exchanged between VMs.
